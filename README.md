# Google Homepage Rebuild

## Purpose

The goal of this project was to improve my front end skills by rebuilding the [Google homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/) from scratch. 🏗️

This was built as part of [The Odin Project's foundational curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).
